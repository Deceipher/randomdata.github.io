    <h2>We have a new blog</h2>
  </header>
  <p>So recently our server crashed. Well... recently, almost two years ago. It pointed out the fact that we didn's spend that much time on system administration and maintenance. The only backup we had was <a href"https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback Machine</a>. After multiple meetings and people promising that they would maintain the infrastructure nothing happened. No problem at all, but it illustrated the need for a maintenance free, low cost, version controlled solution to blog post hosting.</p>

  <p>Today We've build a new blog using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. This post is about how this page is set up and how to use the repository... yes it could be on our wiki, but I decided not to.</p>

    <h4>Project structure</h4>
  </header>
  <p>The important part is that blog posts can be in markdown or in HTML. Markdown is perhaps faster and easier, HTML has more eyecandy and integrates better with the rest of the blog.</p>
<pre><code>

    <h4>HTML</h4>
  </header>
  <p>For the HTML I've build some shortcuts that make writing a post easier. An example for an HTML post is documented in the <a href="/html/template/">/html/template</a> directory. The example in that directory can be used as reference as well. 
  <ol>
    <li>Make a directory in <code>/html/</code> that has a canonical name for the blogpost</li>
    <li>Copy the <code>index.html</code> and <code>content.html</code> from the <code>/html/template</code> directory into your blogpost directory</li>
    <li>Edit the <code>content.html</code> with your content</li>
    <li>Add your post in the root of blogpage repository see <code>/content.html</code>
    <li>Save, git add/commit/push... and done</li>
  </ol>

    <h4>Markdown</h4>
  </header>
  <p>The markdown part is supported by Github pages as Jekyll themes. Which theme is used is documented in the <code>_config.yml</code> in the root of the repository. An example of a markdown formatted page can be viewed in the <a href="/md/template/">/md/template/</a> directory. The example in that directory can be used as reference as well. Documenting in markdown also has the benefit of being <a href="https://github.com/randomdata/randomdata.github.io/blob/master/md/template/index.md">rendered by Github</a> as well. 
  <ol>
    <li>Make a directory in <code>/md/</code> that has a canonical name for the blogpost in markdown style</li>
    <li>Copy the <code>index.md</code> from the <code>/md/template</code> directory into your blogpost directory</li>
    <li>Edit the <code>index.md</code> with your content</li>
    <li>Add your post in the root of blogpage repository see <code>/content.html</code>
    <li>Save, git add/commit/push... and done</li>
  </ol>
